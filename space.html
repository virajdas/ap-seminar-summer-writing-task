                            <li>“How Analyzing Cosmic Nothing Might Explain Everything” by Michael D. Lemonick, published by Scientific American.</li>
                            <li>The article commences by introducing readers to the concept of enormous, empty zones found within space. Lemonick describes these voids through the recounting of a scientifically accurate VR simulation. The article then outfits readers with more information before explaining that, despite knowing of their existence, voids haven’t been the center of attention for astrophysicists, and those willing to dedicate their effort toward studying voids often encountered a lack of computing power and observational data. Times have changed, and the author argues that now is the perfect time for the study of voids to become mainstream due to what they may reveal about the perplexing topics within astrophysics. The article continues, presenting a solution to simplify the study of dark energy: conduct the research within a void; it would ease the difficulty as it eradicates the chaos of matter. Similar arguments are provided for studying dark matter, despite its overall absence within voids. Neutrinos are more complicated as they travel almost at light speed and their masses are unidentified, but the lack of matter may ease their detection. Lemonick concludes by applauding the recent spark of interest in void science while further emphasizing the impact it may have on human understanding.</li>
                            <li>Lemonick’s article contends that focusing scientific research on the recently discovered voids scattered across space will bring about breakthroughs of astronomical impact, granting scientists a further understanding of the hidden forces (including dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino particles) at play within the universe; the article expounds the effects of these hidden forces on the expansion of the universe and elucidates the possible processes to utilize voids in order to study them.</li>
                            <li>The Scientific American feature on voids equips readers with up-to-date information and provides evidence from those on the cutting edge of research. Including the words of those at the forefront of the study gives further insights into the specifics of the troubles faced within the industry and plans to overcome these challenges. Building atop this, Lemonick writes and formats the article in a way where ordinary readers understand the content with ease while passionate scientists receive plentiful information on a deeper level; this degree of mastery in writing is astonishing as it presents complex information in an understandable manner. To further clarify lingering confusion, the author includes a detailed map of known space. Such a magnitude of depth is unheard of, but the article contains a small weakness yet a weakness no less; it is longer than most, and it isn’t properly and efficiently broken down into less intimidating sections. In addition to this, the limited selection of segments that the article has been split up into lacks a heading that signals to readers the discussed concept. Having added clarity by adequately sectioning the article and signposting the overall flow would greatly assist readers when attempting to comprehend given information.</li>
                            <li>The Scientific American article indicates to readers the perspectives of several passionate and optimistic vanguards who have devoted their lives to the study of voids in space. Due to the focus on the scientific possibilities that analysis of voids could bring about, it is of great importance that Lemonick presents their thoughts, ideas, and frame of reference. They will align the intuition of readers to the understanding of experts, thus aligning the opinions and arguments. To be specific, Alice Pisani, a pioneer in void research, is consistently mentioned in the article along with her insights into not only the research of the present day but the prospect of discoveries to come; she details issues of void science study in the past as well. Patently missing from the article are the considerations of people in opposition to the claims, those who believe that void science won’t prove to be the key to understanding the mysteries of the universe; including their thinking and reasoning gives the author an opportunity to organize a response in a counterclaim-rebuttal manner. If done correctly and respectfully, the response/rebuttal to the ideology of skeptics can indue the author with further credibility which aids the overall argument.</li>
                            <li>The author includes abundant information in great detail, mentioning specific scientific applications in order to convincingly argue that void science will lead to the next breakthroughs in humanity’s quest for knowledge; however, the key takeaway, or the most valuable passage, from the Scientific American article addresses this while acknowledging that “void science won’t answer all of astrophysicists’ big questions about the universe by itself. But it could do something even more valuable in a way: test ideas about dark matter, dark energy, neutrinos, and the growth of cosmic structure independently of the other strategies scientists use.” Recognizing the role that voids will play in the scientific world is important, but equally important is the understanding that the study of voids alone cannot uncover the answers to age old mysteries. The excerpt from the article indicates this undeniable relationship between void science and the other aspects of science that bring forth discoveries. It tells those reading that, even if the secrets behind voids are unlocked, the puzzling questions will only grow if science hasn’t matured enough in all of its other areas of study. The ending of the quote makes those reading optimistic about what comes after; what will humanity do?</li>
