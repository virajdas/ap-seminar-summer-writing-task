                            <li>“How to Think About ‘the Metaverse’” by a Wired Insider, published by WIRED UK.</li>
                            <li>The article begins by describing the great confusion surrounding the term “Metaverse” and by attempting to unravel an understandable definition for such a vague concept. In doing so, the author suggests breaking down the broad term into its component technologies and trying to understand from there. The first of the components suggested for readers to look into is the one most often thought of in context of the Metaverse, virtual reality (VR), a means of exploring the digital realms as avatars, digital representations of users. This interaction is the foundation for the Metaverse concept. The article then dives into augmented reality (AR), another major component bringing about the Metaverse; it expounds the applications of bringing digital content into the physical world. The author does, however, point out that today’s hardware is a great limiting factor of the Metaverse as, to achieve global adoption, the hardware must be powerful enough to compute entire worlds while also being small, comfortable, and affordable. The final component mentioned in the article is blockchain which will prove ownership of items in the virtual economy. To close, the author passes down some wisdom to readers who aspire to build this future: change is the only constant.</li>
                            <li>The WIRED article explains that it is crucial for business leaders, current and aspiring, to understand the impact of the coming wave of immersive platforms and the shift toward a digital existence otherwise thought of as the Metaverse; the author breaks down the vague concept of this Metaverse into understandable parts/components that are much simpler for businesses to ideate upon and innovate.</li>
                            <li>The article serves as a valuable starting point for people who are interested in understanding what the Metaverse is. The author breaks it down into component parts and explains each in detail separately which grants readers considerable insights. It’s written in a manner that encourages readers to forge their own connections and piece together the meaning of the Metaverse on their own. The leftover confusion is masterfully tied together in the conclusion where the author provides guiding principles to interested readers while still leaving the explicit definition up to the reader's reasoning. Several weaknesses of the article arise when considering the trade-off between depth and diversity in the examples of applications. In many of the sections, the author would either list many implementations of a concept with a lack of further explanation or will focus on one single implementation and provide ample explanation. Neither of these options are preferred. It would be beneficial to find a balance that provides a multitude of examples while also providing enough context; this way, the nebulous idea of a Metaverse will be clearer. There is also a weakness in accessibility as the author’s name is not listed, which causes complications when utilizing the source.</li>
                            <li>As the target audience for the WIRED article is business leaders, both aspiring and accomplished entrepreneurs, the author includes sections about the possible impacts of the discussed technology on the industry (from a business standpoint) and often provides suggestions for these visionary leaders on better adopting these technologies into their products and their workflows. Distinctly unaccounted for throughout the article is the perspective of consumers and their thoughts on what technology they desire to see businesses provide both for creating and within the Metaverse. This would have further reinforced the credibility of the suggestions to business leaders and would have also reflected the people’s needs on a more specific level. The author usually sprinkles around quotes from people who work in the industry such as Sam Hamilton, the creative director at Decetraland, who briefly explains the impact of virtual worlds and when they may reach a point of feeling like a human experience, but there are no mentions of the people, supporting or opposing. Although the inclusion of some industry leaders’ foresights are very useful to those endeavoring to bring about a Metaverse, it would have also been beneficial for businesses to see things from the perspective of the people.</li>
                            <li>The most valuable part of the article becomes apparent in the closing section where the author states, “Technology does not develop deterministically. No matter how much innovators attempt to will a technology into existence, it’s up to the market to decide if it wants it…the evolution of technology is recursive rather than linear.” The simple fact, contrary to thought, is that the people today control the adoption of new technology, not the big names in the field; the creator may create, but only for as long as the people buy. In addition to this, the author mentions technology’s nature of recursive growth (supportive of Moore's Law) which is essential for tech leaders contributing to the rise of the Metaverse to understand as it allows them to accurately predict not only the arising new technologies to incorporate but also the relative time of their ascent to popularity (to a certain extent). Companies must embrace both of the foundational concepts mentioned in the quote and build upon them to truly succeed and become the next tech giants. Not everything will emerge at once, but it is reassuring to know that all it takes is a spark for a revolutionary technology to blossom.</li>
