                            <li>“At Nearly 70, AI Comes of Age” by Briana Brownell, published by TIME.</li>
                            <li>The article welcomes readers by briefly introducing several astonishing headlines that have recently brought the AI field to the eyes of millions around the world. The author proceeds to dissect the human drive that brings about the fascination for creating such artificial intelligences and finds that it is a deep seated desire to be better than others. Then, reflecting upon the promise of generative AI, Brownell begins to optimistically predict what is to come; to accomplish this, consideration must be given to the history of AI, beginning in 1955 when Simon and Newell’s Thinking Machine proved theorems in Principia Mathematica. The realization settled that computers were masters of deductive logic, but many believed inductive reasoning was the defining skill of intelligence. Various tests of this intelligence were developed for computers, but when DeepBlue defeated Kasparov in chess, AI had proven itself. Unfortunately, the AI still wasn’t capable of learning by forming its own connections, and that’s where machine learning stepped in. Only after the adoption of the internet was there enough data to train a neural network for ML; this allowed computers to perform inductive reasoning. The article closes by describing a better world built cooperatively by AI and humans.</li>
                            <li>Brownell’s masterfully written article explains the evolution of artificial intelligence and its defining achievements while also attempting to foresee possible futures that may arise due to the cooperation of humans and AI; to achieve this, the author dives into the minds of industry leaders and ascertains the cause of AI’s historically slow progression and its recent boom.</li>
                            <li>The article recounts each considerable development in artificial intelligence technology and does so in an understandable, chronological manner where one event leads to the next, just as one technology builds atop various others; this allows readers who are generally unaware of AI’s background to follow the described accounts of major events/breakthroughs with sufficient ease. In addition to including and admirably maintaining an overarching flow to the article, Brownell demonstrates a great deal of writing prowess by seamlessly incorporating relevant quotes from various interviews between TIME and influential people who were involved in many of the events. The artificial intelligence field is, at its core, about looking forward, and the article sprinkles around glimpses into a future world (within reason) by comparing the capabilities of AI in the past versus today. The article is flawed in the sense that the author does not provide adequate support or opinions from current leaders in the field about the impact of more recent developments, and this insinuates that Brownell assumes readers have basic background knowledge about the newer evolutions to the field. The limited referenced sources about neoteric progress are also lacking relevance; having this relevant information would further support the author’s foresights.</li>
                            <li>TIME conducts interviews with many leaders in the field who greatly contributed to the described AI developments, mainly those who were involved with the creation of the discussed technologies. Due to the article’s focus on the evolution of artificial intelligence over the span of 70 years, Brownell includes quotes from these interviews to provide the perspectives and opinions of the insightful minds that propelled the technology to new heights in various years; this merging of the perspectives of experts and of the author is critical to the article which utilizes the collective ideas to foresee possible futures and the overall direction of the innovations. Further analysis brings to light that these predictions do take into account the exponential increase in the rate of technological progress beyond a certain threshold. There is, however, a distinct underrepresentation of the voices and standpoints of the current and arising leaders in the AI industry as the article mainly mentions the viewpoints of the early adopters, discussing their thoughts about their own contributions and only very occasionally about the more recent developments to the field. Including more up-to-date insights from the new big players in AI would benefit the article to a much greater extent.</li>
                            <li>The most valuable part of the article is found in the final section of the article which details artificial intelligence’s permanence in society and its recent developments that have led it to this established state; those developments mainly revolve around machine learning and the ability that ML models have which allows them to learn by making mistakes and trying again. The format of this closing permits the author to adeptly write, “A confluence of trends has made this movement: fast computers and access to massive amounts of data. Neither will vanish, allowing AI to establish a permanent foothold in the mountain of technological progress.” The notion that it took 70 years for enough data and computational power to become readily available is in alignment with some statistics and far off from others, but utilizing these resources, humanity has added another technological breakthrough to the book of history: machines capable of thought. This realization is thought provoking since it encourages readers to embrace the complexity behind AI while thinking about what lies ahead on the referred “mountain.” The excerpt is a powerful statement as it reminds readers that every new breakthrough is a small step on the great journey of technology.</li>
